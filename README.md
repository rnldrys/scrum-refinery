# scrum-refinery
 A very light-weight app featuring tools that can be used for product backlog refinement. This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Try with Docker

If you have docker installed in your machine, you can try out the latest version available in Docker Hub.

First, pull and run the latest docker image:

```
docker run -dp 3000:3000 rnldrys/scrum-refinery
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Start Developing

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
